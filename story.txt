Once upon a time there was a character, Alph, who had to be made because of 
complications in an upper universe. He was created quickly in dubious 
circumstances, so he only had a makeshift home in an unknown, vast forest.

He was alone and has no friends. He has nothing to do in the forest, that is actually
just an empty void as it was a makeshift. However, it changes one day as he discovered
an invisible door to a place, a place that is heavenly like, but is also dark...

He discovered that the door was either the gateway to Paradise or the gateway to Hell, but
he would not know about it until he entered through the door. Furthermore, he had no way of 
coming back after he stepped through the doorway. He could either be trapped in a realm
where he could potentially have lots of friends, an idyllic environment, a place where he
would be free of all troubles; or he could go to a place where he would suffer the rest of
eternity. Else, he could simply live in a lonely forest forever. But how could he decide such
a fate on his own?

He weighed his options, he was already living a life he did not want to being in that
forest, the way he saw it he was already in hell. He places his hand on the door knob,
and slowly turns. The door slowly creaks open and he can feel himself shivering.

After going through the door, he found himself stepping onto cold stone. The door
had only a stone path coming out that stretched over the horizon, but Alph was
overjoyed. This meant civilization! People! The decision was definitely correct.
Surely, he will finally find others and not be lonely anymore.
