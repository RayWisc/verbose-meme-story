Once upon a time there was a character, Alph, who had to be made because of 
complications in an upper universe. He was created quickly in dubious 
circumstances, so he only had a makeshift home in an unknown, vast forest.

He was alone and has no friends. He has nothing to do in the forest, that is actually
just an empty void as it was a makeshift. However, it changes one day as he discovered
an invisible door to a place, a place that is heavenly like, but is also dark...
